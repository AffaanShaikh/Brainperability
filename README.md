# Brainperabilty
    is a comprehensive repository of intricate analysis, operations and experiments done to understand the human brain better.
    
    The idea of this repository is to be a one-stop shop for all brain-related analytics, from analyzing the brain's physiological data, brain waves such as EEG for sleep classification to more hopeful applications like mind control using BCIs, brain-computer interfaces.
