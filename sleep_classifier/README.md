# Sleep classifier
Analizing brain waves and classifying whether a person is asleep or awake. 

Primary data we will work with here is the different types of brain waves during distinguished stages of sleep like EEG (electro-encephelogram) and MEG (magneto-encephelogram).
Real-world data is inputted, analyized and used to train a classification machine learning model. 
A pipeline is imagined where raw EEG data can be fed and accurate classifications on a person's state is output. 
The integration with EEG headsets for real-time data and application like BCI's (Brain-Computer Interfaces) are also aimed for.
